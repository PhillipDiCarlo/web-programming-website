## About Me

Mid Term Mini project - (Adv) Web Programming Course

My name is Phillip, I am a currently a senior at Rowan University and am studying computer science with a concentration in artificial intelligence. I am a hardworking individual who always tries to challenge myself. In my free time I do enjoy a round of golf when it gets warmer out. I am apart of a car club I revived at my university called Car Club at Rowan University where we host weekly meets on campus to meet new people, make new friends, and share our love and passion for the car community.
